let val1 = 'Metropolia'; 
let val2 = "AMK"; 
let val3 = undefined;
let val4 = null;
let val5 = 500;

answer -> 
`/* val1 = character val2 = string val 3 = undefined val4= null, val5= integer`
 
## Exercise 3

colors = ["black", "orange", "pink"]
booleans = [true, false, false, true];
emptyArray = [];

- Use  the following format:
Length of colors: 3 
Length of booleans: 4 
Length of empty array: 0 

## Exercise 6
